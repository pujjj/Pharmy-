## Problem
The healthcare industry generates a massive volume of data, including electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical notes, and health-related social media posts. This data can offer valuable insights into patient health and treatment outcomes. However, much of this data is unstructured, making it challenging to analyze manually.
- Doctors use different terminology which can lead to confusion and mistakes.
- Cost of the same treatment is different in different hospitals which becomes cost insufficient. Difficulties in finding medicines nearby.
- We don't know if hospitals and doctors are actually trustworthy.
- People in rural areas lacks sufficient understanding of medical conditions.
- Often struggle to find reliable information about the disease, available treatment options, and certified doctors and hospitals in their area.

## Our Product
Using a single keyword, such as the name of a disease, we can find out all the information we need about it, including the hospitals that treat it, the best doctors who are qualified to treat it, medicines that are readily available nearby, and articles that increase our understanding of the issue so that we can recognise the signs and effects and take steps to avoid it and stay healthy.


## Objective
This project aims to construct an NLP pipeline utilizing SciSpacy to perform custom Named Entity Recognition on clinical texts from Electronic medical records , Health Records , Radiology Reports , Clinical Trials , Drug Reviews , Medical Research Gap and Social Media.

## Outcome
The outcome will be extracting information regarding diseases, drugs, and drug doses and more from clinical text, which can then be utilized in our web app.
